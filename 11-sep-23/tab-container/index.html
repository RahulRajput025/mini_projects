                        <p>Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the
                            founder and
                            captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most
                            powerful of
                            its top fighters. He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late
                            Gol D.
                            Roger and thereby become the Pirate King, which would help facilitate an unknown dream
                            of his
                            that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and crew. He believes that being the
                            Pirate
                            King means having the most freedom in the world.

                            Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the
                            Revolutionary
                            Army, and the grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, where their family
                            carries the
                            initial of D. At age 7, Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, which turned his body
                            into
                            rubber. Shanks also gave Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature
                            accessory,
                            having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he
                            became a
                            great pirate. Growing up on Dawn Island under the care of Curly Dadan,[36] Luffy
                            befriended and
                            became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace[37] and Revolutionary
                            Chief-of-Staff
                            Sabo.</p>

                            of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and again after
                            reuniting
                            with them as an adult. After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the
                            care of
                            Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy,
                            who
                            convinced him to join his crew.

                            Born in the East Blue, Zoro is the son of Tera and Roronoa Arashi, the grandson of

                            alongside Luffy and Sanji, who are referred to as the "Monster Trio". His dream is

                            the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a promise he made to his deceased

                            friend Kuina.
